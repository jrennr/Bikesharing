## Introduction:
This report is a detailed analysis of NYC Citibike trip data with the aim of proposing a bike-sharing program in Des Moines. The purpose of this analysis is to understand the usage patterns of bike rentals, identify potential trends, and provide insights to convince investors of the feasibility of a similar program in Des Moines.

## Analysis Overview:
The analysis focuses on the NYC Citibike trip data from August 2019. The data includes information on trip duration, user types, genders, start times, and the end times of bike rentals. The primary goal is to gain insights into trip durations, trip frequencies, and user behavior by creating various visualizations.

### Results:

* Duration of Bike Rentals:
By visualizing the duration of bike rentals for all riders and gender, the histogram shows that most rentals last between 5 to 15 minutes, indicating that the Citibike program is used most for short-distance travel.

* Trips by Hour of the Day and Day of the Week:
There is higher usage during weekdays' rush hours, especially between 8 AM to 9 AM and 5 PM to 7 PM, suggesting that the bike-sharing program is heavily used by commuters.

* User Type and Gender vs. Days of the Week:
Subscribers use the service more frequently than occasional customers, and more riders are male.

* Average Trip Duration by User Type and Gender:
Female customers have slightly longer average trip durations than male customers, whereas male subscribers have the longest average trip durations.

* Peak Hours for Different User Types:
Subscribers have a clear peak during morning and evening rush hours, while occasional customers have a more evenly distributed usage pattern throughout the day.

* Weekend vs. Weekday Usage:
Weekdays observe significantly higher bike rental activity, which shows importance of the program for daily commuting.


## Summary:
The NYC Citibike trip data analysis reveals a successful bike-sharing program with high usage during rush hours and weekdays. The short average trip duration highlights the use of the service for short-distance travel. Subscribers form a significant user base, primarily using the service for daily commuting. Male users are more prevalent than females.


For future analysis, we recommend the inclusion of weather data to assess the correlation between weather conditions and bike rental patterns. Additionally, investigating the impact of station density on usage would be very beneficial.
